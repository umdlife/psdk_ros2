# Introduction

`psdk_ros2` wrapper is an open-source project that integrates the DJI's [Payload-SDK libraries](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Payload-SDK) with ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) ecosystem. 

## Key features

The `psdk_ros2` wrapper currently supports the following features:

1. **Starting and Initializing PSDK Applications**: `psdk_ros2` allows you to initiate and configure a PSDK application from within ROS 2.

2. **Subscription to DJI Main Topics**: You can easily subscribe to the main topics provided by DJI, getting access to essential data and information.

3. **Frequency Control for Topic Subscription**: `psdk_ros2` offers the capability to set the frequency of topic subscriptions, allowing you to tailor data retrieval as per your requirements.

4. **Copter Position and Velocity Commands**: With `psdk_ros2`, you can conveniently send position and velocity commands to control a copter's movement.

5. **Camera Management**: `psdk_ros2` provides functionalities to retrieve and update the main parameters of a mounted camera, giving you control over the camera settings. Moreover, you can take photos, videos and obtain the stream on a ROS 2 topic. 

6. **Gimbal Control**: You can manipulate gimbal parameters, adjusting the gimbal's orientation and behavior.

7. **Health management system**: All DJI notifications and errors seen on the RC can be retrieved over a ROS 2 topic.
